# SaaS Website with Admin Dashboard Plan

Based on your requirements for a SaaS application with authentication, admin dashboard, and various functionalities, here's a comprehensive plan for your tech stack and implementation approach.

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides both frontend and backend capabilities with API routes, server components, and excellent SEO support. Perfect for SaaS applications.

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth**: Since you're already using Supabase, leveraging their auth system makes sense

### Database
- **Supabase**: As specified for storing quotations, invoices, and user data

### UI/Frontend
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library built on Radix UI primitives, highly customizable
- **React Hook Form**: For form handling and validation

### Calendar/Todo Implementation
- **FullCalendar** or **react-big-calendar**: Interactive calendar components
- **TanStack Query**: For efficient data fetching from your API endpoints

### Invoice/Quotation Generation
- **React-PDF**: For generating downloadable PDFs
- **React-Table**: For displaying and managing quotation/invoice data

### Webhook Integration
- **Custom API routes** in Next.js to handle make.com webhook integration
- **Zod**: For validating incoming webhook data

### CMS Capabilities
- **PlanetScale** with Prisma or continue using Supabase for content storage
- Custom admin interface for editing website content

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
npx create-next-app my-saas-app --typescript
cd my-saas-app

# Install key dependencies
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
npm install next-auth @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod
npm install fullcalendar @fullcalendar/react @react-pdf/renderer
npm install @headlessui/react @heroicons/react
```

### 2. Authentication Implementation
- Set up Supabase project and configure auth settings
- Implement login/signup pages with NextAuth.js integration
- Create protected routes for the admin dashboard

### 3. Admin Dashboard Layout
- Build responsive dashboard layout with:
  - Sidebar/navbar for navigation
  - Main content area
  - Mobile-responsive design

### 4. Todo List with Calendar
- Implement calendar view with FullCalendar
- Create API endpoints to CRUD todo items
- Store events in Supabase database
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for scheduling

### 5. Quotation & Invoice System
- Design database schema in Supabase for clients, products, and invoices
- Build form interfaces for creating/editing quotations
- Implement PDF generation for printable documents
- Create dashboard views for invoice tracking and management

### 6. Webhook Integration
- Build a webhook configuration interface
- Create API endpoints to receive and process make.com webhooks
- Implement webhook verification and security measures
- Add logging functionality to track webhook activity

### 7. Content Management
- Design editable regions on the main page
- Create admin interface for content editing
- Implement versioning or content history (optional)

important, must not use && in the terminal , instead run it one command at a time

# Website Authentication and Dashboard Setup Guide

This document provides instructions on setting up the authentication system and using the dashboard features.

## Authentication Setup

The website uses Supabase for authentication. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Create a Supabase account at https://supabase.com/ if you don't have one already
2. Create a new project in Supabase
3. Once the project is created, go to Project Settings > API
4. Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
5. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of this project (you can use .env.example as a template)
6. Add your Supabase URL and anonymous key to the `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   ```
7. Enable Email/Password authentication in Supabase: Go to Authentication > Providers and make sure "Email" is enabled
8. (Optional) Configure email templates in Supabase: Go to Authentication > Email Templates to customize the emails sent to users

## Dashboard Features

Once authenticated, users can access the following dashboard features:

### Task Management
- Create and manage tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- View tasks in a calendar view
- Organize tasks by priority or due date

### Invoice Creation
- Create professional invoices for clients
- Track payment status
- Generate and send invoices
- Create and manage quotations

### Webhooks
- Set up webhook integrations with third-party services
- Configure event triggers
- Test webhooks directly from the dashboard
- View webhook histories and logs

### Content Management
- Edit website content sections
- Manage content visibility (published/draft)
- Organize content sections
- Preview changes before publishing

### Settings
- Update profile information
- Change password
- Manage account preferences

## Development Notes

### Authentication Flow
- The middleware.ts file protects all routes under /dashboard/* and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
- After successful login, users are redirected to the originally requested page or to /dashboard by default
- User session state is managed by Supabase Auth Helpers for Next.js

### Database Structure (Not yet implemented)
For a full implementation, you would need to create the following tables in Supabase:
- todos: For task management
- invoices: For invoice management
- webhooks: For webhook configurations
- content_sections: For website content management

Currently, the application uses mock data for demonstration purposes.
